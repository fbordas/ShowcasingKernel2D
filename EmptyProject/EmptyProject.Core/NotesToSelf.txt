animation manager API
	abstract/encapsulate animation process?
	make it easier to run through the entire animation pipeline
	build into separate library maybe? for later reusability? idk
		THIS IS HAPPENING, Kernel2D exists and it's going to be as full a pipeline library as i can make it

resource locator and loader
	after building everything in mgcb-editor, manage compiled media resources
	access all media through resource manager
	build into separate library? for later reusability? idk

STOP FUCKING HOARDING IDEAS AND NOT TRASHING AND DISCARDING WHAT DOESN'T WORK

build preview toolkit using SIP for sprite resources maybe?
	would be solid pipeline tool
	not sure how this'd fit in with rest of engine and dev timeline
	maybe standalone add-on?

SIP output structure spec *already changed*
