This project is but a small showcase of my game dev work on my MonoGame micro-engine, Kernel2D.

Kernel2D is still in active development and getting new features every day, but I'd rather keep the code private. Of course, there's nothing I can do to stop people from using decompilers, but I'm going to trust in people being honorable.

I'll likely make a publicly available closed-source release of Kernel2D soon, as I'm currently working on an actual MVP that I plan to publish and make commercially available.

Zero, MegaMan, and all related characters and trademarks are copyright and registered to Capcom LTD. No infringement is meant by this showcase, it was just the easiest set of sprites I could find to set up and do what I wanted to do with this showcase.
