This project is but a small showcase of my game dev work on my MonoGame micro-engine, Kernel2D.

Kernel2D is still in active development over on my other account, @TohnoCoding, and it's getting new features every day, but I'd rather keep the repo and code private as it's a very near and dear project to me, and the product of several months of grueling work and learning. Of course, there's nothing I can do to stop .Net decompilers from being used, but I'm going to trust in people being honorable.

I'll likely make a publicly available closed-source release of Kernel2D soon, as I'm currently working on an actual MVP that I plan to publish and make commercially available.

Zero, MegaMan, and all related characters and trademarks are copyright and registered to Capcom LTD. No infringement is meant by this showcase, the use of Capcom's sprites was due to them being the easiest set of sprites I could find to set up and do what I wanted to do with this showcase.
