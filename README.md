This project is but a small showcase of my game dev work on my MonoGame micro-engine, Kernel2D.

Kernel2D is still in active development and getting new features every day, but I'd rather keep the code private. Of course, there's nothing I can do to stop people from using decompilers, but I'm going to trust in people being honorable.

I'll likely make a publicly available closed-source release of Kernel2D soon, as I'm currently working on an actual MVP that I plan to publish and make commercially available.
